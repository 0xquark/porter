## Slack

We have a **#porter** channel in the [CNCF Slack][slack]. You can [request an
invite][invite] to join.

🗣 This is a good place to chat with other people about using Porter, developing
Porter mixins.

🐞 This is not a good place to submit bug reports. Please [open an issue][issue]
instead so that we don't miss it!

There is also a **#cnab** channel that is very active where people discuss the CNAB
spec, and work on upstream libraries such as cnab-go and docker-to-oci.
